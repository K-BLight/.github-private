# K-BLight

This is the private README that is only viewable by Organization Members. I'm not too sure what I'll use this for but I figured I'd at least start it off with a copy of the public README. So, here it is:

## Name

The name `K-BLight` is a combination of the name of the company that makes the light, [Kuando][0], and the name of the light itself, [Busylight Omega][1].

## About Project

K-BLight is a project that provides a couple ways to control the [Kuando][0] [Busylight Omega][1] in a number of different ways. To start, it comes with [a CLI tool][3] that allows you to control the light from the command line.

> Important Note: For the CLI to function, the Kuando HTTP Server must be installed and running. To get the software, you must submit a request to [Kuando][0] via their [website][2] and then you can download and install the HTTP Server app.
